================================

Grid Image Search

This Android demo app queries the Google Image Search API to give a infinite scrolling list of images, which can be curated by setting various parameters like image size, image type, color and site filter.

All the required user stories are completed. Optional user stories covered:
Advanced: Robust error handling, check if internet is available, handle error cases, network failures

Also, made sure that the settings persisted across multiple changes and changing the settings instantly gave the new search results.
